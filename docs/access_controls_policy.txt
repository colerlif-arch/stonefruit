Stonefruit Access Controls Policy
Effective Date: February 15, 2026
Owner: Stonefruit Operator

1) Purpose
This policy defines how access to Stonefruit systems and data is granted, reviewed, and revoked.

2) Scope
This policy applies to:
- Source code repositories
- Runtime services and infrastructure
- Secrets and credentials
- Raw and derived data stores

3) Access Principles
- Least privilege: only minimum required access is granted.
- Need-to-know: data access is restricted to valid operational purpose.
- Default deny: access is denied unless explicitly granted.
- Accountability: access is attributable to a specific user/account.

4) Authentication and Identity
- Administrative access uses unique user identity.
- Shared credentials are not used for normal operations.
- MFA is enabled where supported (GitHub, providers, dashboards).

5) Authorization Model
Current operating model (single-operator):
- One owner-level operator administers code and runtime.
- End users do not directly access backend data stores.
- Plaid access tokens remain server-side only.

Future multi-operator model:
- Role-based access control with distinct admin/reviewer/read-only roles.

6) Provisioning and Approval
- New access requires owner approval.
- Access grants are documented with scope and reason.
- Temporary access should include an expiration date.

7) Review and Revocation
- Access rights are reviewed at least quarterly.
- Access is revoked immediately upon role change, no longer needed access, or suspected compromise.
- Leaked credentials/tokens are revoked and rotated immediately.

8) Enforcement
Enforcement controls include:
- Git ignore protections for raw artifacts and local secrets
- Pre-commit secret scanning
- Incident response procedure for credential exposure

9) Exceptions
Exceptions must be documented with:
- Justification
- Risk accepted
- Owner approval
- Expiration date
