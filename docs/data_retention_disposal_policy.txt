Stonefruit Data Retention and Disposal Policy
Effective Date: February 15, 2026
Owner: Stonefruit Operator

1) Purpose
This policy defines retention and secure disposal requirements for Stonefruit data and credentials.

2) Scope
Applies to:
- Secrets and credentials
- Raw ingested data
- Derived data and read models
- Logs, exports, and backups

3) Data Categories
- Credentials/tokens (API keys, access tokens, client secrets)
- Raw source data (financial, location, metadata)
- Derived analytics data
- Operational logs
- Backups and exports

4) Retention Principles
- Retain data only as long as needed for operational and legal purposes.
- Minimize retained sensitive data where possible.
- Separate raw storage from derived and output layers.

5) Retention Baseline
Unless legal obligations require otherwise:
- Credentials/tokens: retain only while active and required.
- Raw data: retain only for ingestion validation, derivation, and required auditability.
- Derived data: retain according to product utility and legal requirements.
- Logs: retain minimally and rotate regularly.
- Backups: retain according to recovery needs with expiration dates.

6) Disposal Triggers
Dispose data when:
- No longer needed for the original purpose
- Retention period expires
- User/legal deletion requirement applies
- Credentials/tokens are revoked or compromised

7) Disposal Procedures
7.1 Credentials/Tokens
- Revoke at provider endpoint/dashboard.
- Remove from local stores and non-required logs.
- Rotate replacements as needed.

7.2 Raw/Derived Data
- Delete data from primary stores when no longer required.
- Remove obsolete local databases, exports, and backups on schedule.
- Ensure sensitive artifacts are excluded from source control.

7.3 Source Control Exposure Response
If sensitive data is committed:
1. Revoke exposed tokens/keys immediately.
2. Remove sensitive files from tracking.
3. Rewrite history and force-push sanitized branch.
4. Verify no exposed values remain in reachable history.

8) Compliance
- Retention and disposal decisions must comply with applicable law and contractual obligations.
- This policy is operational guidance and not legal advice.

9) Verification and Audit
- Periodic checks confirm ignored sensitive paths remain ignored.
- Secret scanning is enforced pre-commit.
- Incident records include retention/disposal remediation details.

10) Enforcement
Current enforcement controls include:
- .gitignore protections for raw artifacts
- Pre-commit secret scanning
- Credential/token revocation process
