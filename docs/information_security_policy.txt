Stonefruit Information Security Policy
Effective Date: February 15, 2026
Owner: Stonefruit Operator

1) Purpose
This policy defines administrative, technical, and operational security controls for Stonefruit.

2) Scope
Applies to all Stonefruit code, environments, credentials, logs, and data stores.

3) Security Objectives
- Confidentiality: protect financial and personal information.
- Integrity: prevent unauthorized data modification.
- Availability: maintain reliable ingestion and processing operations.

4) Governance
- The owner is accountable for security control implementation and policy maintenance.
- Security-relevant changes are documented in version control.
- Policy exceptions are time-bound and documented.

5) Core Controls
5.1 Secrets Management
- Credentials and tokens are never committed to source control.
- Secrets are stored in environment variables or a secure secret store.
- Exposed credentials/tokens are revoked and rotated immediately.

5.2 Secure Development
- Developer reviews staged diffs before commit.
- Pre-commit secret scanning is required.
- Sensitive runtime artifacts (raw DBs, dumps, exports) are ignored by Git.

5.3 Data Protection
- Data collection is minimized to operational need.
- Access tokens are server-side only and not exposed to clients.
- Raw and derived data are separated by layer and purpose.

5.4 Logging and Monitoring
- Logs must avoid plaintext secrets.
- Security events are logged (failed access, revocations, remediation actions).

5.5 Dependency and Patch Management
- Dependencies are updated routinely.
- Critical security issues are remediated promptly.

6) Incident Response
When an incident is suspected:
1. Contain: revoke or disable affected credentials.
2. Eradicate: remove exposed artifacts and fix root cause.
3. Recover: restore service in secure state.
4. Document: timeline, impact, and corrective action.
5. Improve: update controls to prevent recurrence.

7) Business Continuity
- Critical configurations and required operational data are backed up.
- Recovery steps are documented and periodically tested.

8) Compliance and Review
- Policy is reviewed at least annually or after a significant security event.
- Controls are updated as legal, technical, or operational requirements change.
